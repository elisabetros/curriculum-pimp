    <h1>Exams</h1>
    <p>Exams All exams cover the core areas of the semester’s compulsory programme element.<br> Exam procedure<br> Exams usually consist of three elements:<br> 1. Presentation<br> 2. Examination<br> 3. Grading<br> The specific requirements regarding exams
      are published on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme.<br> Grading
      <br> The exam is assessed by one or more examiners according to the 7-point grading scale and is based on the extent to which the goals and learning objectives of the first semester have been fulfilled as described in the curriculum.<br> Spelling
      errors
      <br> Spelling and writing skills are taken into account in the assessment of the final exam project. The assessment should be regarded as an overall evaluation of the academic content and the student’s spelling and writing skills; however, with
      the greatest emphasis being placed on the academic content. If the project contains a large number of major spelling and writing mistakes, the grade awarded may be lowered by one increment, for example from 7 to 4.<br> Re-exam
      <br> Students who fail the first exam attempt are offered two more attempts. Re-exams take place as soon as possible. Students are entitled to a re-exam based on the same project, a revised project or a new project. KEA provides advice on the advantages
      and disadvantages of the three methods in relation to the individual student’s work. The purpose of the re-exam is the same as for the ordinary exam.<br> Appeals
      <br> Appeals against exams will be handled in accordance with the rules set out in Part 10 of the Ministerial Order on Examinations on Professionally Oriented Higher Education Programmes (the Examination Order).<br> Commencement of studies exam<br>      KEA holds a commencement of studies exam for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme. KEA informs students about this shortly after the start of the programme. Students on the Multimedia Design and Communication programme must participate
      in and pass the commencement of studies exam to continue on the programme. The commencement of studies exam is intended to establish whether students have actually commenced their studies. The exam consists of a number of tasks related to fundamental
      elements from the first 7-8 weeks of the programme. The commencement of studies exam must be held no later than two months after the start of the programme, and the result must be announced to the students within two weeks of the exam. The commencement
      of studies exam is assessed internally as ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’. Students who fail the exam have the opportunity to participate in a re-exam (only one), which is held no later than three months after the start of the programme. Students are entitled
      to two attempts to pass the commencement of studies exam.<br>

      on the basis of relevant business practice and applied theory.<br> On the programme, teaching methods are used which are aimed at developing the students’ independence as well as their collaborative and innovative skills. <br> Practice-oriented learning<br> The teaching is interdisciplinary and practice-oriented. It primarily takes place in an open
      environment rather than the traditional classroom setting. The learning environment is designed to be flexible, so as to allow lecturers and students to meet in both formal and informal settings to handle interdisciplinary problems in connection
      with projects and tasks undertaken for public and private organisations.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>compulsory and elective<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>The core areas, courses and learning objectives are divided between three compulsory semesters to ensure the same academic/professional Curriculum for the Academy Profession Degree Programme in Multimedia Design and Communication
      Copenhagen School of Design and Technology 24 progression and level of complexity for all students. <br> The specialisation takes place in connection with the elective subjects in the third semester. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>internship<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>The internship in the fourth semester ensures
      that students acquire practical knowledge about the profession and learn how to handle practical issues. The final project in the fourth semester adds new perspectives to the student’s specialisation and internship through the application of academic
      theory and method to a practical issue.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Project work<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>KEA places great emphasis on project work, on contact with the business community and on use of the latest technologies. The project-based working method provides students with important
      teamwork experience, and through working in a problem-oriented study environment, students acquire experience with the formulation of problem statements and problem solving. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Credit transfer<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>Successfully completed
      programme elements are equivalent to the corresponding programme elements at other educational institutions offering the programme. <br> Students are obliged to provide information on completed programme elements from other Danish or foreign higher
      education programmes and on any employment for which credit transfer may be granted. On a case-by-case basis, KEA approves credit transfers based on completed programme elements and employment comparable to subjects, programme elements and internships.
      The decision is based on an academic evaluation.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Studying abroad<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>KEA helps students find programmes at foreign educational institutions with learning objectives equivalent to the Multimedia Design and Communication programme.<br> Having
      passed the first-year exam, students can choose to complete either the entire programme or parts of it abroad. KEA offers multiple possibilities for international study, including the fourth semester internship. Information on partner institutions,
      international internships, credit transfers and procedures are published regularly by KEA.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>others<sub>&nbsp; &Hacek; &nbsp;</sub></h3>
        <p>In so far as is relevant, the programme covers issues like entrepreneurship, environmental issues and the dynamics of intercultural encounters.<br>Academic/professional progression<br> The programme is structured around four core areas, which are further divided into a number of sub-topics, each with their own learning objectives.<br>Process and method are essential parts of the learning environment at all times and also form part of the basis for assessment in connection with tests and exams.<br> Motivation
      <br> An important requirement for completing the programme is active participation in classes, project work and guidance sessions. Students are expected to share in the responsibility for their own learning, which requires motivation and commitment,
      independence, plenty of initiative and critical thinking. This is a condition for students being able to actively participate in the organisation of their own work – not least in connection with projects.<br> </p>
