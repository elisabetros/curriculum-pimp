    <h1>Exams</h1>
    <p>Exams All exams cover the core areas of the semester’s compulsory programme element.<br> Exam procedure<br> Exams usually consist of three elements:<br> 1. Presentation<br> 2. Examination<br> 3. Grading<br> The specific requirements regarding exams
      are published on the learning platform for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme.<br> Grading
      <br> The exam is assessed by one or more examiners according to the 7-point grading scale and is based on the extent to which the goals and learning objectives of the first semester have been fulfilled as described in the curriculum.<br> Spelling
      errors
      <br> Spelling and writing skills are taken into account in the assessment of the final exam project. The assessment should be regarded as an overall evaluation of the academic content and the student’s spelling and writing skills; however, with
      the greatest emphasis being placed on the academic content. If the project contains a large number of major spelling and writing mistakes, the grade awarded may be lowered by one increment, for example from 7 to 4.<br> Re-exam
      <br> Students who fail the first exam attempt are offered two more attempts. Re-exams take place as soon as possible. Students are entitled to a re-exam based on the same project, a revised project or a new project. KEA provides advice on the advantages
      and disadvantages of the three methods in relation to the individual student’s work. The purpose of the re-exam is the same as for the ordinary exam.<br> Appeals
      <br> Appeals against exams will be handled in accordance with the rules set out in Part 10 of the Ministerial Order on Examinations on Professionally Oriented Higher Education Programmes (the Examination Order).<br> Commencement of studies exam<br>      KEA holds a commencement of studies exam for the Multimedia Design and Communication programme. KEA informs students about this shortly after the start of the programme. Students on the Multimedia Design and Communication programme must participate
      in and pass the commencement of studies exam to continue on the programme. The commencement of studies exam is intended to establish whether students have actually commenced their studies. The exam consists of a number of tasks related to fundamental
      elements from the first 7-8 weeks of the programme. The commencement of studies exam must be held no later than two months after the start of the programme, and the result must be announced to the students within two weeks of the exam. The commencement
      of studies exam is assessed internally as ‘Pass’ or ‘Fail’. Students who fail the exam have the opportunity to participate in a re-exam (only one), which is held no later than three months after the start of the programme. Students are entitled
      to two attempts to pass the commencement of studies exam.<br>

      with projects and tasks undertaken for public and private organisations.</p>
